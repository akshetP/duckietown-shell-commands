Stacks are stored in this directory.

Each stack is identified by a unique 'name' (e.g. 'interface-ros1' or 'demo-lane-following').

All available stacks are listed in the 'available/' directory.

All enabled stacks are listed in the 'enabled/' directory.

The 'enabled/' directory contains symbolic links to the actual stack directories in the 'available/' directory.
